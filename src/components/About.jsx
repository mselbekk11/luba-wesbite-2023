      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I believe in being deliberate with my actions, intentional with my words, and acting and living with purpose, both personally and professionally..</p>

<p>To achieve these goals, I force myself to step out of my comfort zone and to think outside of the box.</p>

<p>So long as I am constantly moving forward, while empowering myself and others to achieve tangible results, I feel as though I am succeeding. For success is not an end goal, but a way of life.</p>
